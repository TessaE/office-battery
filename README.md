# Office Battery

Check out this project at: https://tessae.github.io/office-battery/

üîã This project is called "Office Battery", but really a more accurate (and longer) name would be "My own personal battery on a typical day at the office". 

By default, this battery gets drained slowly over the course of 8 hours. However, its levels are affected by outside factors: cups of coffee, a noisy office, bugs getting discovered or fixed...  

üè¢ Project first created as part of HackDays at work - 2 days in which we get to hack at our own quick projects in order to learn new things & be creative.

It was built in Vanilla js using Vite. It makes heavy use of the (awesome) JavaScript Web Animations API.
It also uses the canvas-confetti package found here: https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti
